B. BerSU Ball
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
The Berland State University is hosting a ballroom dance in celebration of its 100500-th anniversary! n boys and m girls are already busy rehearsing waltz, minuet, polonaise and quadrille moves.

We know that several boy&girl pairs are going to be invited to the ball. However, the partners' dancing skill in each pair must differ by at most one.

For each boy, we know his dancing skills. Similarly, for each girl we know her dancing skills. Write a code that can determine the largest possible number of pairs that can be formed from n boys and m girls.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of boys. The second line contains sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the i-th boy's dancing skill.

Similarly, the third line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of girls. The fourth line contains sequence b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bj ≤ 100), where bj is the j-th girl's dancing skill.

Output
Print a single number — the required maximum possible number of pairs.

A. Kefa and First Steps
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. He knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n) he makes ai money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence ai. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n integers a1,  a2,  ...,  an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a.
